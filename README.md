This is a simple landing page created for the odin project to test my skills.
the assignment is to make it look the most possible similar to this:
"https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png"
As for the assignment we can choose a topic for our page, and i choose cryptocurrencies.
